## Welcome to my learning journal!

My name is Sheraim Mascal and I was born and raised in the Cayman Islands. A short trip to Italy with a fellow wanderer sparked my love for travel and ever since then I've been trying to think of ways I could do this for a living. I am firm believe that work shouldn't feel like, well, work!

I was lucky enough to find out about Women in Code (Cayman).  I've always been interested in computers, programming, building apps, etc. and when I saw this course was being offered by CEC I immediately jumped at the opportunity.

Technology has changed the way we live and has had a major impact on how we now do business. Advancements and upgrades are being developed everyday, and I believe that broadening one's knowledge of coding and digitization will not only expand their boundaries and appreciation for programming, but can also create another world of opportunities.

 I'm looking forward to "decoding" the language of computers and developing another skill that can be used in many (if not every) area of my life.
