In steps Women in Code (Cayman).  I've always been interested in computers, programming, building apps, etc. and when I saw this course was being offered by Cayman Enterprise City I immediately jumped at the opportunity.  I'm looking forward to "decoding" the language of computers and developing another skill that can be used in many (if not every) area of my life.
